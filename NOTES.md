To improve the database behind the API, I suggest a few best practices. First, I recommend using UUIDs instead of varchar for primary keys, which can help with data consistency. Adding foreign keys between related tables, like bookings and users, will keep the data linked correctly. It’s also important to use the right data types for each column, index key columns for faster searches, and organise the database to reduce duplicate information.

Explanation of the Latest Practices in Frontend Development:

Frameworks: like React, Vue.js, and Next.js encourage building UIs using reusable components. This improves maintainability, scalability, and efficiency in UI development.

Utility-First CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for faster and more maintainable styling by using small, composable classes.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automating testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions or Bitbucket Pipelines ensures reliable code delivery and quicker iteration cycles.

Version Control: Using Git and platforms like GitHub for version control is essential for collaboration, tracking changes, and managing project workflows effectively.

Implementation Details:

In this project, I built a frontend application using React and TypeScript that connects to a backend API at http://localhost:3001/api/1. The app fetches all data and shows it to users. If there's a problem retrieving the data, it displays an error message to let users know something went wrong.

For testing the frontend, I wrote simple tests for the ApiDataComponent using Jest and React Testing Library. These tests check if the app shows a loading message while fetching data, displays the correct data when the API call is successful, and shows an error message if there’s a failure. By simulating different situations, these tests make sure the app works correctly and helps catch issues early.
